	abstract = {Pollution caused by plastics and, in particular, microplastics has become a source of environmental concern for Society. Their ubiquity, with millions of tons of plastic debris spilled in both land and sea, requires efficient technological improvements in the ways residues are collected, handled, characterized and recycled. For reliable decision-making, dependable chemical information is essential to assess both the nature of the plastics found in the environment and their fate. In this work an efficient method to identify the polymeric composition of microplastic fragments is proposed. It combines infrared reflectance spectra and chemometric methods. A breakthrough result is that the models include polymers weathered under both dry (shoreline) and submerged (in sea water) conditions and, hence, they are very promising as a starting point for eventual practical applications. In addition, no spectral processing is required after the initial measurement.
Synopsis
This approach to identify microplastics in aquatic environments combines infrared measurements and multivariate data analysis to fight against (micro)plastic pollution.},

	abstract = {A high-throughput approach to detecting, quantifying, and characterizing microplastics (MPs) by shape, size, and polymer type using laser direct infrared (LDIR) spectroscopy in surface water samples is demonstrated. Three urban creeks were sampled for their MP content near Cincinnati, OH. A simple Fenton reaction was used to oxidize the surface water samples, and the water samples were filtered onto a gold-coated polyester membrane. Infrared (IR) analysis for polymer identification was conducted, with recoveries of 88.3\% ± 1.2\%. This method was able to quantify MPs down to a diameter of 20 µm, a size comparable to that of MPs quantified by other techniques such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. A shape-classifying algorithm was designed using the aspect ratio values of particles to categorize MPs as fibers, fibrous fragments, fragments, spherical fragments, or spheres. Cut-off values were identified from measurements of known sphere, fragment, and fibrous particles. About half of all environmental samples were classified as fragments while the other shapes accounted for the other half. A cut-off hit quality index (HQI) value of 0.7 was used to classify known and unidentified particles based on spectral matches to a reference library. Center for Marine Debris Research Polymer Kit 1.0 standards were analyzed by LDIR and compared to the given FTIR spectra by HQI, showing that LDIR obtains similar identifications as FTIR analysis. The simplicity and automation of the LDIR allows for quick, reproducible particle analysis, making LDIR attractive for high-throughput analysis of MPs.},

	abstract = {Snakebites cause mortality and morbidity in tropical regions. Bites by Viperidae and Elapidae family snakes are common in Turkey. Snake venom characterization and anti-venom production are important in the diagnosis and treatment of snakebites. Our objective was to develop a method for analyzing all venoms by identifying basic protein structures in venom using a MALDI-TOF-MS and to create a venom library. Five Viperidae family and one from the Elapidae family venoms, were identified. Although the proportions vary depending on the species and subspecies, the identification procedure involved determining the protein structures of PLA2, VEGF, svMP, CRISP, svSP, PIII-MP, and LAAO, common to all venoms. Six matrices (CHCA, DHAP, DHB, SA, S-DHB and THAP,) with the MALDI-TOF-MS and six snake venoms were studied separately. On the other hand, peptide profiles were studied in the mass range of 1000-10000 Da using reflectron mode. It was found that biomarkers peptides were 4398, 4026, 6395, 3800 and 6672 Da for ML, MX, VAA, VBB, VAM and WA respectively. The highest relative abundance values of the protein signals were mostly obtained with both the CHCA and the DHAP matrices. Some targeted protein structures were not observed in studies involving the S-DHB and the THAP matrices, and those were detected exhibited relatively low abundance.},

The result showed that Raman spectroscopy remains a cost effective, rapid, and user-friendly method, which if combined with DL and NNLS leads to fast implantation in the identification of lactose dominated drug (LDD) formulations.

Background models formed using NMF are used to perform anomaly detection, and additionally, models are augmented with spectral templates of gamma-ray sources to perform simultaneous detection and identification using a likelihood ratio test. The NMF-based detection and identification algorithm is benchmarked against a standard Region of Interest algorithm and shows significant performance gains. In addition, NMF-based anomaly detection shows improvements over methods based on gross counts or principal component analysis. Algorithm performance is evaluated using unshielded sources with activities between 5 and 400 μCi at a standoff distance of 20 m using source injection on background data collected using a 1 m2 NaI array on the Radiological Multisensor Analysis Platform.},

In its classical form, NMF is an unsupervised method, i.e. the class labels of the training data are not used when computing the NMF. However, incorporating the classification labels into the NMF algorithms allows to specifically guide them toward the extraction of data patterns relevant for discriminating the respective classes. This approach is particularly suited for the analysis of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data in clinical applications, such as tumor typing and classification, which are among the most challenging tasks in pathology. Thus, we investigate algorithms for extracting tumor-specific spectral patterns from MSI data by NMF methods.In this article, we incorporate a priori class labels into the NMF cost functional by adding appropriate supervised penalty terms.

Conceptually, the premise of this approach is that the tandem MS fragmentation pattern of a peptide under some fixed conditions is a reproducible fingerprint of that peptide, such that unknown spectra acquired under the same conditions can be identified by spectral matching. In actual practice, a spectral library is first meticulously compiled from a large collection of previously observed and identified tandem MS spectra, usually obtained from shotgun proteomics experiments of complex mixtures. Then, a query spectrum is then identified by spectral matching using recently developed spectral search engines. This review discusses the basic principles of the two pillars of this approach: spectral library construction, and spectral library searching. An overview of the software tools available for these two tasks, as well as a high-level description of the underlying algorithms, will be given. Finally, several new methods that utilize spectral libraries for peptide identification in ways other than straightforward spectral matching will also be described.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is one of the techniques most commonly employed in material characterization and identification. However, software licensing and proprietary file format limitations are commonly encountered hindrances when analyzing FTIR data. Spectrometers are generally provided with a license for a single copy of the operation/analysis software to run the machine, with additional copies requiring the purchase of software licenses. Furthermore, incompatibility between file formats across different spectrometers and spectral analysis software dictates additional limitations on analysts wishing to characterize spectra generated by devices incompatible with their software. This communication reports on the development of a free and open-source FTIR peak detection software, at the center of which is an in-house developed peak detection algorithm implemented in JavaScript (JS).},

	abstract = {Many commercially available software packages have been created to analyze gamma-ray spectra, but their source code has generally not been shared, although some users may wish to add or modify certain functionality, which is impossible without access to the source code. This study therefore presents a new open-source software package for the analysis of gamma-ray spectra. The name of the software is GSA (Gamma-ray Spectra Analysis), the source code of which is freely available through the GitHub website (https://github.com/LAHCEN-EL-AMRI/Gamma-Spectra-Analysis). The main function of this initial version of the software is to locate peaks, calculate areas, and identify corresponding radionuclides. A future version will complement this by measuring the concentrations of radionuclide elements. The software was validated by comparing its analysis results with those generated by three other software programs, namely Genie 2000, Maestro, and FitzPeaks. All the formulas used are explained in this work, which could be useful for researchers or students looking to create their own software packages for analyzing gamma-ray spectra.},

	abstract = {Microplastic pollution research has suffered from inadequate data and tools for spectral (Raman and infrared) classification. Spectral matching tools often are not accurate for microplastics identification and are cost-prohibitive. Lack of accuracy stems from the diversity of microplastic pollutants, which are not represented in spectral libraries. Here, we propose a viable software solution: Open Specy. Open Specy is on the web (www.openspecy.org) and in an R package. Open Specy is free and allows users to view, process, identify, and share their spectra to a community library. Users can upload and process their spectra using smoothing (Savitzky–Golay filter) and polynomial baseline correction techniques (IModPolyFit). The processed spectrum can be downloaded to be used in other applications or identified using an onboard reference library and correlation-based matching criteria. Open Specy’s data sharing and session log features ensure reproducible results. Open Specy houses a growing library of reference spectra, which increasingly represents the diversity of microplastics as a contaminant suite. We compared the functionality and accuracy of Open Specy for microplastic identification to commonly used spectral analysis software. We found that Open Specy was the only open source software and the only software with a community library, and Open Specy had comparable accuracy to popular software (OMNIC Picta and KnowItAll). Future developments will enhance spectral identification accuracy as the reference library and functionality grows through community-contributed spectra and community-developed code. Open Specy can also be used for applications beyond microplastic analysis. Open Specy’s source code is open source (CC-BY-4.0, attribution only) (https://github.com/wincowgerDEV/OpenSpecy).},
